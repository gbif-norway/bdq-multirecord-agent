It was concluded that a test VALIDATION_SCIENTIFICNAMEID was justified as CORE while this test should be SUPPLEMENTARY.  The original test ""VALIDATION_TAXONID_AMBIGUOUS"" was seen by the TG2 team as too complex to implement. If we use any single bdq:sourceAuthority such as GBIF, a valid and complete dwc:taxonID based on an alternative source authority is unlikely to provide a valid match.
